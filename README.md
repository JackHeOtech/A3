Project Theme: Workout tracker
My application will be a simple workout tracker that will allow the user to log the workout they did, the duration and the date the workout was completed. 
There will be a page that allows you to log your workout session and input the type of workout(s) you did through a textbox. The duration and date of completion will be a drop down box with different time interval and a textbox to input the date.
View Create Update and Delete functionality will be implemented and the Update section will autofill with the previous inputs4
I wanted my site to look like those workout trackers you can write on, sort of like a reading log:

As for the style.css file I have decided to create my own
